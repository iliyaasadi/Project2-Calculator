# Calculator

This project is a calculator with 4 main operators(summation , minus , 
multiplication and division ) and also some of the semi-professional operators . 
In this program , I used java swing ( graphics in java) because the graphic part is the main part of it , and also there is a logic part for handling and calculating.

I hope that my code help you in your projects and researches.

## Appendix

Notice that there are some other operations like sin , cos , tan but they have their own library and because of that , they are easier than the operators that I used in my calculator .
